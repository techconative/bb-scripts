## bb-scripts

This project is meant to contain the utility scripts written in Clojure, meant to run on https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka], a GraalVM utility to run Clojure.
Since babashka is available for Mac, Windows and Unix environment, this scripts can be used in all of those environments.

## Pre-requisite:

You'll be required to have babashka(bb) installed in your system to make use of the scripts in this.

## Purpose:

A couple of reasons,

- Based on the different project requirements, I'm required to work across different OS, I miss certain commands, especially, when I have to work on Windows.
- At times I need certain utilities which are not commonly avaialble, so thought of building it on my own.

## Setup:

(Currently available only for mac)

Once you have `bb` setup abd having `bb-scripts` checkedout, add the below line to your initializing script (`bashrc`, `zshrc`, or similar files)

```
BB_SCRIPTS='Fully qualified path of where you checked out the script'
source $BB_SCRIPTS/scripts/source-bb-utils-<your-os>.sh
```
## Utils available:

### `frequency`:
Gets the frequency of the lines available in a given text file.
Ex,
```
cat <file_to_get_frequency>|frequency
```
Or,

```
frequency -f <file_to_get_frequency>
```
